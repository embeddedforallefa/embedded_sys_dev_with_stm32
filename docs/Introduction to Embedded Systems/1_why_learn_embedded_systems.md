# Why You Should Learn Embedded Systems

Imagine. while you are walking down the street, you overheard someone saying "Embedded Devices are everywhere". This thought stuck in your mind. All this while these devices seem to hide from you but now these devices started appearing.

As you entered the house, you couldn't help but notice something different. The familiar surroundings seemed to have a subtle glow of excitement. Curiosity sparked within you as you glanced around, and you soon realized that your home was filled with embedded devices, each quietly performing its unique task.

As you stepped into the living room, your eyes were drawn to the smart TV mounted on the wall. It greeted you with a vibrant display, showing your favorite cartoon character. You marveled at how the TV, with its embedded system, brought entertainment to life with stunning visuals and crystal-clear sound.

Moving further into the house, you noticed a small smart speaker sitting on the shelf. With just your voice, you could request your favorite songs and hear them fill the room, thanks to the embedded system within the speaker. It was like having a personal DJ at your command.

In the kitchen, you found a smart refrigerator. It had a sleek touchscreen display that showed a digital inventory of groceries, reminding you of items that needed to be restocked. The embedded system in the refrigerator also adjusted the temperature settings automatically, ensuring that the food stayed fresh for longer.

As you headed upstairs, you reached your bedroom, where your alarm clock glowed softly. The alarm clock, with its embedded system, not only woke you up each morning but also tracked your sleep patterns, helping you get a better understanding of your restful nights.

Next to your bed, your bedside lamp caught your attention. It responded to your touch, adjusting its brightness as desired. It amazed you how the embedded system within the lamp could transform a simple lighting fixture into a personalized source of illumination.

As you made your way through the house, you realized that embedded devices were not just in plain sight but also hidden within the walls. The thermostat regulated the temperature, making the house comfortable, while motion sensors detected movement and turned on lights automatically, conserving energy.

The realization dawned on you that your home was a testament to the wonders of embedded systems. These unassuming devices were all around you, silently working together to enhance your family's daily life. The embedded systems brought convenience, efficiency, and entertainment, transforming your house into a smart and connected home.

In that moment, you felt a surge of inspiration. You are captivated by the possibilities of creating your own embedded systems, imagining the incredible devices you could design to make the world an even better place. With a newfound excitement, you made a mental note to learn more about embedded systems and start your own journey of exploration and innovation.
