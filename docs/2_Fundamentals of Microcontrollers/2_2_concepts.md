Word : The STM32F40x is 32-bit microcontroller. Here 32-bit means the '**word**' size is of 32 bits. This ‘word’ is a piece of data handled by the instruction set of the microcontroller. The size of the word differs in each microcontroller between 8 bits, 16 bits, 32 bits and even 64 bits. A word can be used as an address, a variable, a register or an instruction. In an 8-bit processor, 8 bits are used in every instruction. 16-bit and 32-bit processors can operate with larger amounts of data. Larger register or bus widths, means less restrictions on resources.
